## Description

The goal of this assignment was to use node.js, npm inquirer, and template literals to create a program which helps a user generate a ReadMe.md. Once the user begins to run the program, using the node index.js command, they answer a series of questions and prompts which allow them to fill in information regarding the title, description, installation instructions, usage, contribution guidelines, testing, and how to contact them with any question regarding their repository, and gives the user several license options to choose from. Once the user has answered all the questions, their input is plugged into a ReadMe outline, and their selected license is also populated, complete with a license badge at the top of the README that is a clickable link to the license page, and links to their GitHub profile and email.

## Installation

It is necessary to have node.js installed on your computer, and the inquirer package must be downloaded in order to run the program.

## Usage

This project is meant to be used for generation of a personalized ReadMe for your project.
